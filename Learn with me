#calculating the simple interest

#converting age into integer value  in the same line

#elif statement in python with grading system with multiple elif statement

#Introduction to lists in python something like reviewing a website 

Names = ["Neymar","Ronaldo","Messi"]
print(Names)

# 0 belongs to Neymar . 1 belongs to ronaldo , 2 belongs to messi 

print(Names[0]) you will get Neymar as the result
print(Names[1])  you will get Ronaldo as the result

#List operations in python 

numbers =[1,1,1,1,1]
#inserting a value in the list 
numbers[2]=5
print(numbers)

#creating a new list 

new_numbers =[2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8]

#combining two lists 

print(numbers+new_numbers)
#multiplying the list
print(numbers*3)

checking if something particular is present in the list

print("Apple" in Fruits)

#List functions in python 
# 1st function is Append- used to add something in the list  
Fruits.append("Oranges")

# 2nd function is to track the length of the list - l
print(len(Fruits))

# 3rd Insert function 
Fruits.insert(1,"Kiwi")

#4th INDEX function - it is used to know which place is for a particular position
print(Fruits.index("Peaches"))

#Range function in Python - #Important 

numbers = list(range(10))
print(numbers)

#starting and ending point of the range
numbers = list(range(10,1000))
print(numbers)


#having an interval in the list
numbers= list(range(10,1000,100))
print(numbers)

#Code reuse - what if we want to reuse the code again in the later part of the code 
#print('My name is Sumit Khurana')
#print(" Fruit is bananna")
#print("I live in delhi")

# so we define  a function add the context and you can call that function anytime you want  

def function1():
  print('My name is Sumit Khurana')
  print(" Fruit is bananna")
  print("I live in delhi")


#when you call the function the data inside that function will be executed
function1()

#For Loop in python - How it can be used to print out the element inside the list 
for x in range(1,11):
  print(x)

# if you want to repeat your name 5 times 
for x in range(1,6):
  print("Sumit")

#to execute each and every item in the list for loop can be used, X will print till the range or the number of items in the list
for x in Fruits:
  print(x)

#executing even numbers from a list with the help of range
for x in range(0,21,2):
  print(x)

#Boolean logic - And operator - with this operator both the conditions has to be true  

username ="admin"
password ="admin123"

if username == "admin" and password == "admin123":
  print("valid user")
else:
  print("invalid user")

#Boolean logic - OR operator - only one condition has to be true , for a false statement both the conditions has to be false 

username ="user"
password ="admin123"

if username == "admin" or password == "admin123":
  print("valid user")
else:
  print("invalid user")
